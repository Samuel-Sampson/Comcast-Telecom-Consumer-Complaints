# Comcast-Telecom-Consumer-Complaints

Business Scenario: Comcast is an American global telecommunication company. The firm has been providing terrible customer service. They continue to fall short despite repeated promises to improve. Only last month (October 2016) the authority fined them a $2.3 million, after receiving over 1000 consumer complaints. The existing database will serve as a repository of public customer complaints filed against Comcast. It will help to pin down what is wrong with Comcast's customer service.

This project is a part of the Simplilearn Data Science Master's Program

This Repository includes:

2) Jupyter Notebook with the source code
3) A PDF write-up of the analysis
